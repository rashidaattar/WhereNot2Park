Database Documentation 

1. In the table 'coordinates' I have added a foreign key constraint that references to 
	the subId of 'markerdata' This will make sure no rogue entries make way into the DB
	I have also used the "on update cascade" and "on delete casacade" to the coordinates table, so any changes 
	to the subid in markerdata will result in an updation in the coordinates table also and 
	if any row in markerdata is deleted, the corresponding coordinates will also be removed
	So less work later for us.
